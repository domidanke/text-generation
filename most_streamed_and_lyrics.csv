I sit around  
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry  
Strange voices are saying (ah, what did they say)  
Things I can't understand  
It's too close for comfort  
This heat has got right out of hand  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
It's a cruel  
  
The city is crowded, my friends are away, and I'm on my own  
It's too hot to handle so I gotta get up and go, and go  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer

Dropped my crutches  
And crawled on the floor for you  
Went looking behind every door for you  
And because of the things  
That I saw for you  
I spiritually grew

In the gap between a deepening day you come slowly  
The darkness skims by and wakes me up  
And across the open window receding away  
  
Have you, you, you lost your way again  
The night air is still cold, get up  
So, baby, hold on I'm worried of leaving you alone  
I leave the road and follow behind you  
  
You shower in the pouring moonlight  
I haven't seen that entrancing expression before  
I look at you who's stopped like a picture and at the end of that gaze  
  
A place where I can't touch you and can't even hold you  
What's shining under the surface is not that person  
Your sad story that can't come true  
The closer you go, the more you'll hurt, so  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Like this I'm anxiously calling you  
Don't go babe, those wings will get wet  
  
No matter how much I tell you, you don't listen  
You throw your whole body towards him again  
Why do you dream a dangerous dream  
(Now stop those tiring [actions]) So that your heart can rest a little  
My heart watching you feels as if it'll rip as well  
  
You shower in the pouring moonlight  
I haven't seen that entrancing expression before

A place where I can't touch you and can't even hold you

Don't go babe, those wings will get wet  
  
Like nothing happened you try  
Even though you're smiling towards me  
Your slender and pale shoulders shake a little, I'm telling you  
It's okay if you let everything go and rest at my side for just a little while  
When the sun rises, follow the place where the moon gets dark, fly away then,
yeah  
  
A place where I can't touch you and we can't be together  
What's shining under the surface is not that person  
Your sad story that can't come true  
The closer you go, the more you'll hurt, so

Sweep the streets I used to own  
  
I used to roll the dice

Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never, never an honest word  
That was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I can feel your golden skin on mine  
Beneath the desert sky  
So how can it be true  
How can you just turn and let me go  
Let the story of your life with mine  
Forever go untold

She's ripped from her sleep  
as the cold luna sweep gains control

Ah, ones you barely recognize  
In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh

Where a monkey's her date  
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon

said the seagull to the loon  
What you gonna do with your emotions

Maybe together we can get somewhere

Starting from zero got nothing to lose  
Maybe we'll make something  
Me, myself I got nothing to prove  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Won't have to drive too far  
Just 'cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
  
You see my old man's got a problem  
He live with the bottle that's the way it is  
He says his body's too old for working  
His body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away  
We gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way  
  
So remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
We'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do of your kids  
I'd always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me would find it  
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

Where voices carry at the speed of sound  
If I should cry before they lay me down  
  
Sorry for the words, words I left unsaid  
Sorry being one of the words I did forget  
All the time we spent, wasted in the end  
Every precious moment taken for granted  
There in the corner of my mind  
Lies the weight of my regret  
Between the shadow and the light  
Ghost you're in my head  
  
Shelter from the storm when I sleep  
There's comfort in the morn, a siren sings  
If only for a moment, I can breathe  
The thought of you comes crashing through on me

I'm sorry for the way, the way I treated you  
A little bit too late, but if you only knew  
I'd take away the pain, pain I put you through  
I'd do it all again walking in your shoes

Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup  
When n-ggas play tough, wont even smile in mirrors  
And we learn to f-ck hoes off trial and error  
Just a small time n-gga, big city hustle  
Glued to the tv, Jigga, Diddy, Russell  
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's  
For that Robert Deniro, n-ggas reload on them kilo's  
Dodgin them people,  
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell  
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too  
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do  
Pull up to the club where the boys went too  
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue  
A n-gga on a strecther and though I never met ya  
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya

Yea, lets see God  
I know you only do what's best for me  
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny  
They always tellin' me it's temporary  
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary  
My dreams aint got no obituaries  
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here  
You heard me say I was ballin'  
I probably make tears  
I'm trying to get clear  
I'm tryna quit fear  
Who wrote the scripts here  
These kids live there whole life just killing time  
Running the race with no finish line  
They tryna noose us with they ropes  
But I'm tryna climb  
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide  
But I aint tryna go, no baby  
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope  
Cause I aint dying  
My words gon' last forever,  
You can hold the treasure  
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind  
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean  
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen  
I think I'm in the [?] I see lo green  
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings

It seems like n-ggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya  
I face the sky and hope to God aint acting unfamiliar  
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar  
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya  
Iller a n-gga from artist pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out  
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side  
Where they rock with them thangs out  
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out  
But will it change, it's like n-ggas is free but our minds still in the chains  
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame  
Will it ever slow up  
A lot of n-ggas getting older but they never grow up  
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up  
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life  
Watch the season n-gga no re-runs  
The devil buying soul's n-gga no refunds  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya  
Another day, another song, a mother prays  
Another gone  
But still we play like aint nothing wrong  
Like aint nothing wrong  
Cause aint nothing wrong  
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall  
But before I pass  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
N-gga I gotta ball

When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down

That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours

Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancing with another man

Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

To try and apologize for my mistakes

I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours

He can always buy some cheap thrills with his money  
His world of silence has become much too loud  
But ho, don't forget them demons  
They're still right by his side  
Causing all kinds of hell, yeah

I gotta shake you off  
'Cause the loving ain't the same  
And you keep on playing games  
Like you know I'm here to stay  
I gotta shake it off  
Just like the Calgon commercial  
I really gotta get up outta here  
And go somewhere  
I gotta shake it off  
Gotta make that move  
Find somebody who  
Appreciates all the love I give  
Boy I gotta shake it off  
Gotta do what's best for me  
Baby and that means I gotta  
Shake you off  
  
By the time you get this message  
It's gonna be too late  
So don't bother paging me  
Cause I'll be on my way  
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes  
Just ask your momma she knows  
You're gonna miss me baby  
Hate to say ""I told you so""  
Well at first I didn't know  
But now it's clear to me  
You would cheat with all your freaks  
And lie compulsively  
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton  
Jumped in your ride and took off  
You'll never ever find a girl  
Who loves you more than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off  
  
I found out about a gang  
Of your dirty little deeds  
With this one and that one  
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets  
Heard y'all was  
Hold up my phone's breakin' up  
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back  
I gotta get this off of my mind  
You wasn't worth my time  
so I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I need a real love in my life  
Save this recording because  
I'm never coming back home  
Baby I'm gone  
Don't cha know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

Arrival of the Carnival  
  
New beats, I never recycle  
  
While your looking for samples  
  
You might get trampled  
  
Surprise, hey  
  
I'm back with lightning and thunder  
  
I heard you over saying that i was a one year wonder  
  
You dumb or some, i went to refugees  
  
Silly felony, when i'm done  
  
Collect royalty from record company's  
  
Clouds getting darker  
  
Suns getting nearer  
  
I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer  
  
The back of a building  
  
Your body's found by children  
  
Playin' hide go seek  
  
All we found was his skeleton  
  
In the back of a car  
  
You spawned with the wrong guard  
  
You know my empire strikes back hard  
  
Listen hard, war  
  
This is the day after action  
  
Projects, cannons  
  
Being launched at the palace  
  
Vision, revelation

Aiyyo, Back on earth  
  
The party is in the tunnel  
  
On the west side of the river  
  
Went mad quiver  
  
Rats get fed to the alligator  
  
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor  
  
Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima  
  
I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror  
  
I was on the highway pushing a black viper  
  
A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper)  
  
A blue range rover, he says pull over  
  
I didn't know he was a DT undercover  
  
I screamed out my lungs  
  
This is discrimination!  
  
He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station  
  
Who me? not me! it couldn't be  
  
I was in the Grammys with Brandy  
  
Didn't you see me on tv?  
  
Bullshit, y'all all in the same game  
  
He tried to run me off the road  
  
Like he was rosco, rico or dre  
  
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show  
  
Cause when its time to go  
  
All i gotta press is turbo  
  
Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west  
  
Things got serious, that's when i bust a left  
  
you-Turn, my eyes burned  
  
My concern was a truck coming  
  
Head on collision within a chase position  
  
Close one, i almost went up in a blaze  
  
Running from what appears to be a masquerade  
  
Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind  
  
Reality stuck when i got to the borderline  
  
The headline reads every ghettos sad story  
  
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity...

not, the record (fades out)

Young bitch  
But I'll be like damnnnn  
All I got is one dick  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Bridge:] Santogold  
  
I got the talk  
The beats and bass  
Give me one I'll take it  
Make you lose your place,  
Tell me I-I-I can play  
So I speed up the pace  
I break it break it you can't stop me  
In this ra-race  
  
[Chorus 2x]

Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet  
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a  
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid  
For them dead presidents we will start digging graves  
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work  
They say the best things in life are free  
That's why it cost for you to get get murked  
And my pants saggin like fuck it, I'm still on my business  
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions  
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green  
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds  
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart

Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?  
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor  
And her birthday suit is her pajamas  
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner  
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner  
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him  
I get Adam like Yolonda  
Young Money Cash Money's Obama  
Its fuck the world, no condom  
If he twisted, I'll unwind him  
And this pistol came with a silence  
  
But I swear to God he heard it!  
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous  
Na, I swear to God I ain't nervous

That even mother couldn't tell.  
But my baby's so vain,  
She is almost a mirror.  
And the sound of her name,

Down my spine.  
  
I keep her photograph against my heart,  
For in my life she plays the starring part.  
Our love could hold off cigarettes,

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away  
To save the world or go to work  
It's the same thing to me  
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition  
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him  
And I know every word that you say, yay  
You smile and say, ""How are you?""  
And I'll say, ""Just fine""

But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah

He's not as bad like this reputation

Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be  
Right here wishing the flowers were from you  
Wishing the card was from you  
Wishing the call was from you

But I've seen quite a bit  
Some things I'll always remember  
Some things I wish that I could forget  
I haven't quite been around the world  
But I've been around the block  
I know that distances are meaningless  
Like the hands that move around a clock  
And I know that love is everywhere  
Always safe, always true  
And exactly where it comes from  
Is where it's going to

Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong  
The harbor and the lights  
They're like diamonds in the heavens  
Enough to brighten the darkest of nights  
There's another side to sorrow  
As there is to everything  
Like the other side of lonely  
Is falling in love again  
And then you know that there's an answer  
To the suffering we see  
And though it isn't easy  
It's still as simple as you and me  
And you'll know that love is everywhere  
Always safe, always true  
And exactly where it comes from  
Is where it's going to

[Diddy]  
The world at my sneakers,  
Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features,  
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether,  
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for,  
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh,  
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper,  
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,  
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,  
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,  
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle,  
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,  
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,  
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,  
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest,  
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project,  
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,  
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja  
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra,  
It's Harlem usa I diddy bop and shop with Oprah,  
(Yeah nigga, what.)

From my voice I'm killing 'em,  
I she'd my blood,

To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker,  
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer,  
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster,  
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha,  
I call it rich ignorant laughter,  
Black American express card all grey now, it's scratched up,  
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags,  
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra,  
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya,  
Bring friends wontcha?  
I'm from the 80's nyc 5 percent of culture,  
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,  
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing,  
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her,  
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,  
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar,  
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,  
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,  
(Yeah nigga, what.)

The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker,  
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber,  
Heister, my own life biographer,  
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping,  
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,  
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers,  
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me,  
Draped in paisley bandanas,  
Suits with Adam Stacey,  
Cigar like dick Tracy,  
Its dark I get spacey,  
Alcohol and laced weed,  
That was part of my 80's,  
The Cartier consigieres be near me,  
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,  
Liz Taylor tried to joke me  
Coz I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be  
When he gets mean,  
Think fast before I blast hoes,  
Like Grassino,  
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion,  
And realest rappin',  
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,  
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas,  
Two of New York's biggest niggaz,  
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us,  
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers.  
(Yeah nigga, what.)

And the way you teased the menfolk  
The jury all agreed you knew no shame knew no shame  
  
Well I'm glad that you can't see me now  
You'd probably say that I do not look my best  
Those lawyers took my money that Louisiana road gang took the rest  
And Judy I can't even conjure up your picture in my mind today

In my longing to give up the pain  
I just didn't believe I would ever love again  
  
I was like one who had shut myself in  
Closed the windows, locked all the doors  
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart  
Yet knowing there had to be more  
Though it sounds like a great contradiction  
It's the easiest thing to explain  
You see, I was afraid I might never love again  
  
What does it take for a blind man to see  
That there's more there than just meets the eye  
What are the ways that the magic comes in  
That can turn a song into a sigh  
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming  
Or maybe I'm going insane  
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again  
  
Here I am standing beside you  
Oh life's such a wonderful game  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love again

A lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
Take a look in the five  
And ten glistening  
Once again  
With candy canes  
And silver lanes aglow  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight  
To see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair  
Of hop along boots  
And a pistol  
That shoots  
Is the wish  
Of Barney and Ben  
  
Dolls that will talk  
And will go for a walk  
Is the hope  
Of Janice and Jen  
And Mom and Dad  
Can hardly  
Wait for school  
To start again  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
There's a tree  
In the Grand Hotel  
One in the park as well  
The sturdy kind  
That doesn't mind the snow  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing  
That will make them ring  
Is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart

Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa Tell Me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 1]  
Feeling Christmas all around  
And I'm trying to play it cool  
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room  
Let It Snow is blasting now  
But I won't get it in the mood  
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Don't make me fall in love again

Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been down this road before  
Fell in love on Christmas night  
But I knew you say I woke up and you wasn't by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold  
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Don't make me fall in love again

Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh  
On the 25th by the fireplace ooh  
But I don't want no broken heart  
This year I've got to be smart  
  
Oh baby

There's nothing left  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
  
It wasn't that I didn't try  
It's not the kind of thing, that you buy  
Written in my destiny  
Life is but a dream  
Covered by the sky  
Stop saying that you're calling time  
Look at your life before you start on mine  
I'm not the kind of person that you need  
I'm sick of trying  
I mean that it's over  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
It was always special  
it was like water down the drain  
  
Patiently you wait for me  
You're so blind  
I thought it couldn't be  
Then changed my mind  
Drowning in the endless sea  
Line all those lines  
The traces of your memory  
Don't belong with mine

The orange and palm trees sway.  
There's never been such a day  
In Beverly Hills, L.A.  
  
But it's December the twenty fourth,  
And I am longing to be up north.  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,  
Just like the ones I used to know.  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,  
With every Christmas card I write.  
May your days be merry and bright,  
And may all your Christmases be white.  
  
May your days be merry and bright,  
And may all your Christmases,  
All your Christmases,  
All your Christmases be white.

How can I avoid infinity? How have I annoyed infinity?  
I'm movin' slow in infinity. I even glow in infinity.

How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?

I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.

Feel the whispers as you head for the plane

Love and linen sheets seem so very far away  
You save your pennies and you buy another day  
But after all it's only hide and seek, just another game  
There's so much fun to be had when you're living with a name

Starlight open wide everybody is a star  
Split screen 8-hour movies  
We've got color we've got sound  
Won't you recognize us, we're everything you hate  
Andy loves old Hollywood movies, he'll scare you hypocrites  
to death  
You know that shooting up's for real  
That person who's screaming, that's the way he really feels  
We're all improvising, five movies in a week  
If Hollywood doesn't call us - we'll be sick  
Starlight open wide  
Do to movies what you did to art  
Can you see beauty in ugliness, or is it playing in the dirt  
There are stars out on the New York streets  
We want to capture them on film  
But if no one wants to see them  
We'll make another and another  
Starlight let us in that magic room  
We've all dreamt of Hollywood, it can't happen too soon  
Won't you give us a million dollars the rent is due  
Andy will give you 2 movies and a painting  
Starlight open wide!

Take Jesus as your daily guide  
Though you may feel pure and safely  
Without Him walking by your side  
But when you come to make the crossing

If you ever will meet our Savior  
You'll surely meet Him on that day  
  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at these deep waters  
Look at that wide river  
Oh hear the mighty billows roar  
You'd better take Jesus with you  
He's a true companion  
For I'm sure without Him  
That you never will make it o'er  
  
That awful Day of Judgment  
Is coming in the by and by  
We'll see our Lord descending  
In Glory from on high  
So let us keep in touch with Jesus  
And in his grace the Love of God  
That we may be ever called ready  
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide

Oh how, how you gonna feel

'Cause every minute brings them that much closer  
Closer  
  
So on this silent night  
I call your name  
And suddenly all time and space disappears  
I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory  
And even though you're gone  
I know you're here  
As close as the glow is to the ember  
  
You've always been a part of me  
Now living in my heart you're even closer

I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory

I know you're here....  
As sure as there's snowfall in December  
  
Your love lives in everything  
Summer Winter Fall or Spring  
Every thought of you will bring us closer  
The distance may be large or small  
  
Someday I pray that we may all be  
Closer...  
Closer.

'Cause my heart's too numb to feel  
And the smile does all the talking  
Though the pain is all that's real  
With the way that you keep screaming  
I can hardly hear to think  
And I feel the bridges burning

And I'm left alone and beaten  
For this cross I choose to bear

Though the road's still long and the light is still far  
But I finally found what I'm looking for  
  
Well, the voices fall like timber  
And the fear it pours like rain  
And my heart is crushed to cinders  
Underneath this kind of pain  
Well, there is no resolution  
When the revolution's dead  
So I'm left with no solution  
For the voices in my head

The poisoned river waters flow

They could be black, they could be white  
Tell me who's knocking at the knocking shop door tonight  
  
Not much a girl can do but open or close  
Those things are above doors  
Not much legs can do but open or close  
Those things are above us whores  
  
So imagine a mirror  
Bigger than the room it was placed in  
Imagine my wish for a future that cannot hold my wish  
Imagine the want to hold a rod that cannot hold the fish  
Imagine a rod that cannot hold the fish  
  
They could be lonely or could be bust  
They could be tack, they could be real  
They do have feelings, but just right now I feel  
  
A feminine receptacle, that's just what I am  
Those things are above us whores  
Just the best target practice, for a misguided man  
Those things are above us whores  
  
So imagine a mirror  
Bigger than the room it was placed in  
Imagine my wish for a future that cannot hold my wish  
Imagine the want to hold a rod that cannot hold the fish  
Imagine a rod that cannot hold the fish

Put your chewing gum in my fist  
And pass the last over of your drink  
I've known you long enough to know  
Yeah I'm in deep and it shows  
I met her on grand final day  
And from sixteen thousand miles away  
Yeah I knew  
I was in trouble deep past me boots  
  
You think it's so hard  
Alone in the world  
Yeah well just try keeping up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
So I strayed (keep your head in the sky)  
Til my fingers all burnt in a sneeze (leaving nothing behind)  
And I'm holding by the skin of my teeth  
She got me grinning like a karaoke king  
Without a clue on how the thing begins  
And that's where the hell I'll reside  
In between the width of her smile  
So if you spy me just let it be  
I'm far beyond what you knew of me  
  
You think it's so hard  
Alone in the world  
Yeah well just try keeping up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
You're never alone  
It's you against the world  
You're the uninvited oyster next to the pearl  
The best lesson I learned  
  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Me, keep up with that beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl [Repeat x4]

And I'm so glad you found me

When you finally find something real  
My angel in the night  
You are my love  
The love of my life  
  
Now here you are  
With midnight closing in  
You take my hand as our shadows dance  
With moonlight on your skin  
  
I look in your eyes  
I'm lost inside your kiss  
I think if I'd never met you  
About all the things i'd missed

She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist  
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?  
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps  
But first, you gon' remember how to forget  
After all these long-ass verses  
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

I walk the floor in the middle of the night and stare  
Out the window of an ugly motel  
At the neon signs outside
